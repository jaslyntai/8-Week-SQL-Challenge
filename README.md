# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my approach to solving Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge as part of my SQL learning journey.  

Without installing a database management system or acquiring a database administrator, there is still ways to learn and practice SQL skill.
<br>For this challenge, I have employed SQLite on Jupyter Notebook to present my solutions.
<br>I believe there is no perfect solution to anything and everything but there is always room for improvement.
<br>Therefore, I would appreciate any feedback given so feel free to drop any comments/thoughts on my solutions!
