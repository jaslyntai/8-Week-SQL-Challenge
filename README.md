# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my approach to solving Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge as part of my SQL learning journey.  

Despite having no access to SQL platforms, there is still ways to learn and practice SQL skill.
For this challenge, I have employed SQLite on Jupyter Notebook to present my solutions.
I believe there is no perfect solution to anything and everything but there is always room for improvement.
Therefore, I would appreciate any feedback given so feel free to drop any comments/thoughts on my solutions!
